                    The entry of Arogya Health Care into the state dominated healthcare sector in 2011, saw
                    the private health care system take root in Sri Lanka. The launch of the hospital and the
                    overwhelming response it received from the people demonstrated a long felt need for
                    superior healthcare in a pleasant environment. <br><br>

                    As Sri Lanka’s first premier multi-specialty hospital, Arogya Health Care was set up to mirror reputed
                    hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical
                    care, thus eliminating the need for people to travel out of Sri Lanka for specialized
                    medical treatment. <br><br>

                    The Hospital was a pioneering initiative, established under the Chairmanship of Late
                    Deshamanya H. K. Dharmadasa, to be a centre of excellence in high technology diagnostic and
                    curative facilities. Driven by the Vision to be the Hospital of Tomorrow, the medical institution
                    has come to be known as a centre of excellence and a preferred healthcare institution in the country.<br><br>
